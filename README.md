# Boston-House-Prices
Explored the different variables that go into determining median house values,and saw if I could use different machine learning models to predict these values.

## General Information

Tasks I completed: 

1) Conducted exploratory data analysis

2) Built a Linear Regression Model, Decision Tree Classifier, and a Support Vector Machine

## Tools Used

Python

## Project Status

Project is: complete

## Room for Improvment

1) Could have chosen to split up the dataset into training and test data based off of a different variable, such as Crime, or even nitric-oxide concentration, just to see any change in results

2) I would have chosen to focus my analysis more on the Charles River dummy variable, which would have allowed me to use different ML models
